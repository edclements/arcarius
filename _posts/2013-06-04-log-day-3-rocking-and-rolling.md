Hi All,

Another great day sailing if a bit rolley! Bit of cloud around today and the NE wind still has a bite to it.
We have been in contact via VHF with several of the other boat in the fleet but they are pulling away now and I don’t think we will hear them in the morning. I do feel sorry for the fast boats they could loose out an extra days sailing by the end of the trip (Ah well that will teach them to have fast boats)

Hours and days seem to be passing really fast now we are in a routine of eating, sleeping and all the other things you have to do on a boat!

That’s it for now skipper Gary signing off
