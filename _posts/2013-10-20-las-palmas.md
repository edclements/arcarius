Now well settled into Las Palmas for the next 5 weeks. Lots to do to prepare
the boat: repair sails, sort loo, solve charging problem, etc etc. I have heard
that liver-board cruising is about maintenance in the sun!  One advantage to a
small mast is that you can always spot your own boat in an anchorage! Can you
spot Arcarius?
