Hi All,
Day started in sublime fashion,light winds ,not a cloud in the sky cruising along at about 4 knots .Very relaxing after Derek and i had done a 2 hour watch system with not a lot of sleep! Only downside is that Paul has not felt well ! on the positive side for him is that has got some serious Zeds' in like 2 days and nights solid .I am sure he will shake it off soon and be back to his perky self ! This evening winds have been gusting 25 knots and Arcarius is going like a train with a top speed of 9 knots (well down a wave anyway! )Solar panels working well,Cruising chute has been great after being up for most of the day.We do have a problem with the Alternator which I might have to fix in Spain Otherwise we live in a perfect world.
