A long day sail on Thursday 19th took us to the Portuguese fort town of Al
Jadidah. No marina here so it was coming alongside in a fishing port teeming
with activity 24 hours a day.

Then into town for an explore of the 17th Century fort with a massive cistern
maybe 2500 sq metres by 6 metres high which held the fort’s water during the
sieges from the indigenous population. The guide said it was used for Orson
Wells’ Othello and in the Hareem.
