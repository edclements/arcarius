Tony brings with him from England a pair of expensive prescription sunglasses courtesy of Marian following the loss of his previous pair on a night time swim. Within one hour the new pair are lost as well; what is the captain like. Let’s hope he doesn’t get lost going to Morocco. Later that day the glasses are recovered from the bilges.
