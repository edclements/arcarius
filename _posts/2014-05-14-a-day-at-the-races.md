A double full moon, over Webster, lit the start of the second leg, as the gun
went off Captain Horacio Webster lead the Amanda with his dosy crew, the two
tricle miners and their Solvinian Tumbling acrobat.  Webster was in first
position leading the fleet through the channel and away from Bermuda to the
cries of Hi Ho!  Arcarius, a smaller vessel formed part of the B class and the
Skipper looking cool didn't raise the jib until the last minute.  Some of the
Bermudian children were diving from rocks on one side of the channel and on the
other, the committee stood and some members of the public to salute the fleet
as they left the security of Bermudas harbour. 

The infamous Bermuda Triangle, outside the protected waters, awaiting the
chance to lure in any boat that strayed from the course. The start went well
for Arcarius, she was mid fleet and wanting to accelerate.
