Now leaving the carribbean after an amazing 6 months heading for Bermuda (will
update Carribbean trip at later date, no time spent too much time enjoying
myself) The photo is typical of the dancing in the Carribbean, bit unusual but
it is a different culture! Shame I could imagine us dancing like this in
Broad Street Wrington!
