What a fish! Fantastic! It only has taken 3500 miles since leaving Plymouth to catch it. It was such a beautiful fish I nearly put it back! But it tasted great! We have now settled into a normal routine of living on the boat. After going through hell, gusting 50 knots of wind, we are now in heaven, 7 knots of wind sailing at 4.5 knots. Life is good.
