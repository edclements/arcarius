Gary and Tony are in a tiny port of Mohammedia on the Moroccan coast. Getting authority to come ashore was particularly time consuming with no fewer than 4 agencies all wanting our details (Police, Immigration, Customs and Port Authority). In all 2 hours were spent filling in forms including details of Marian (as joint boat owner). A massive drug smelling hound also came on board
