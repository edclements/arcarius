What an amazing island isle de Graciosa is, we were treated to a fantastic
night of locals singing with some great characters and then Tony took me on a
bike ride around the island!!!!! Off to Lanzarote in the morning.

More musings from the absent minded sailing professor Gary and Tony

PS Red letter day today I havenâ€™t lost anything!!
