Coming from Safi we come across a pod of about 100 dolphins who showed off to Arcarius for nearly half an hour

For the next leg a 5am start took the lads to Esouaira where for the third day it was rafting to something in a fishing port. This time rafting up to a locay yacht taking Moroccan tourists to a local islane.
