Day trip to Taroudannt between the Atlas mountains and the Anti Atlas mountains on the way I missed a photo of pigs flying but i did snap one of goats pretending to be birds, beyond Taroudannt we visited on oasis by donkey ( poor thing!!) he did seem a chirpy little chap though, unbelievable the loads they do take. Every family around here seem to have one. A bit more Eco friendly than all our cars!!
