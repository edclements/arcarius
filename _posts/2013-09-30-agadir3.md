After a couple of days cleaning the boat and catching up on washing I visited
the old city on the hill, totally destroyed by an earthquake in 1960! For your
information the wording on the hill stands for God,King and country! (another
useless bit of information!) Plus had an exciting trip to the supermarket.
Weather is nice and warm at 32C  gets cold at night though at least 20C.
