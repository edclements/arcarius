After all the great photos it is now time for a reality check this is a photo
of my new loo (quite exciting really!) it took about 30 minutes to fit I then
spent the next 2 days descaling all the pipes divert-er valve and holding tank
,you clear the pipes by banging them on the pontoon and watch the scale etc all
shoot out (over me the boat and everything else ) in fact the Americans on the
next boat were not impressed! Thank goodness the Russians on the boat the other
side have not been on board as I am sure I would of started ww3 .This was all
fine but it then took another day trying to work out why the loo did not divert
to the holding tank! Yes you guessed I had fitted the pipes the wrong way round
and of course I marked the pipes before I took it apart but I marked them
wrong! I now feel really satisfied I have a nice sweet smelling Loo All this
could of been avoided if people did 20 pump outs when they used the loo. I will
need to be more assertive when explaining how the loo works

Another reality check this is a little house for cockroaches it has painted
windows and it even has a step for the little cuties to walk into the house
then it kills the little buggers. So far I have only sprayed to death two. I
have set up 6 little houses but no takers yet so it looks like i am not
infested yet. Mind you the ones on the pontoon are massive well about the size
of a 50p I will try and get a photo to share with you! I wonder if thats why I
go to bed scratching and then jump out of bed and find nothin!

Hmm I seem to of started scratching again..
