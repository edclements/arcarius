The finish! 21 days 9 hours 2840 miles, avg speed 5.4 knots, best days run 170 miles, worst 85 miles, top speed surfing 13.8 knots, 2nd boat in our class, 14th in the cruising division, engine use 110 hours 495 miles, end result on corrected time and engine use 7th in class of 19 boats and 52nd out of 162 cruising boats.

No major damage: dorado vent ripped off by main sheet, plotter stopped working after a few days but no big deal (new aerial now ordered), lifebouy ripped off when boom touched the water! Apart from that Arcarius went like a dream!!
