Tony returns and we are ready to go! Well 3 hours later when our passports are
returned we finally leave Agadir after a wonderful stay. Sad to see the end of
Morocco after 4 amazing weeks but looking forward to arriving in the Canaries.

Arrived on Isla Graciosa and entered a beautiful little harbour that is usually
very difficult to get into but some smart talking by Tony got us in on Sun 6th
Oct.
