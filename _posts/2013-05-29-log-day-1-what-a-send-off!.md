Hi All,
Fantastic send off from family and friends from Wrington Bristol, Exmouth & Cardiff!!
You all looked amazing up on the ramparts.
Well what a day! Glorious sunshine all day now watching the sunset, crew
asleep, Paul not feeling too good but another sleep should sort him (slept all afternoon bless him-now2100hrs) downside was the light winds so it was an engine job! but now under cruising chute doing 7 knots in 14 knots of app wind fantastic!
So what have we seen today? Well we have seen the sea and then some more sea brilliant!
Not heard about any world disasters, nobody trying to kill each other, the world is at peace with itself (well out here anyway)
Thats it for day one
Cheers Gary
