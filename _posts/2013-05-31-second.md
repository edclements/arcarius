Another great day at Mayflower Marina with all the flags flying and lots of hustle & bustle. Last food shop now done extra fuel on board (not of lot of wind by the look of the latest weather forecast!!)
Photo is of Derek sorting the bilges after I have not screwed down the cap on
the spare diesel enough. Ah well these things happen, lucky I have obliging crew!!!! 

Cheers for now Gary
