Time to leave the tourist hot spot of Essaoiura where we are rafted up off a fisheries rescue boat. Spent the previous night thinking what if there was a fishery vessel in distress – would we find ourselves still attached as the rescue boat flies off at 26 knots to the rescue?

and head off again onto the ocean – out with the cruising shute.
