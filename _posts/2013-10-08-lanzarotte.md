Tuesday 8th Gary and Tony left the gorgeous island of Graciosa  and turned
south to the Canaries proper. – note the old red ensign (Gary
lost his new one in a tangle).

Then past the 1700 volcano in N Lanzarotte with its culdera – they
cook dinners up there in the ash.

Had a great sail in winds gusting over 20kts down past all the Lanzarotte
hotels – absolutely all of them are painted white – need a salesman to come
over here to try and sell some colours. And then down to the south of the
island to the port of Calero. After 4 weeks of very basic harbours we find one
with hot showers and even polished brass bollards.
