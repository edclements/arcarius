<p>2 more days and counting!!! Just had a quick lift and scrub off Arcarius bottom now clean and ready for the off!! Must add at least 0.1 of a knot!. Safety inspection went off with flying colours. Didn&#8217;t realise I was that good. All that prep paid off. Now cleaning the rest of the boat. I love my handheld Dyson best bit of equipment on the boat (am i sad or what?)</p>

<p>Cheers for now (a very excited) Gary</p>
